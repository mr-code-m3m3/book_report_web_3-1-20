        <h1>Wires And Nerve Volume 2</h1>
        <h2>By Marissa Meyer</h2>
        <h2>Art By Stephen Gilpin</h2>

        <p>Summary</p>
        <p>An overview about the book is the main characters are Alpha Steele, an evil wolf man that wants to see earth destroyed and the Luna kingdom to be burned alive because they turn him along with many others into wolf-like people. We also have Wolf and Scarlet, Wolf is a wolf and Scarlet is a human. They both like each other, even when Wolf went to join Alpha Steele in destroying earth. Then we have Liam and Iko, Liam is basically a secret service agent mix with a CIA agent, Iko has the same job but is a robot girl that has a special AI that makes her act human. Lastly we have Kai and the Luna queen Cinder, Kai is the leader of earth and Cinder is the leader of the Luna society that lives on the moon. The setting of this story is mostly within Beijing China, but does move back and forth to the Luna kingdom on the moon. A quick run down of the story is Alpha Steele wants to be normal again and gets Wolf to join him in becoming human again, but Cinder and Kai tell him that it is not scientifically possible to do. Alpha Steele gets mad and decides to go after Cinder, blaming her and her family for what they did to him and he also goes after earth. Iko and Liam are tasked with stopping Alpha Steele and protecting Cinder and Kai. Iko and Liam did that, especially because they found out Wolf was working as a spy and was able to get important information about Alpha Steele plan. They captured Alpha Steele and opened his follower eyes to the new world that is being created between Luna and earth. The theme of this book is to always look forward. </p>

        <p>Rating</p>
        <p>“Wires And Nerve Volume 2” by Marissa Meyer gets a score of 5.5 out of 10 because this book has good parts in it but there are many bad parts that don’t add up with the good. For example, towards the end of the story, Liam and Iko hash out a plan to fake out Alpha Steele and his group when they went to crash Cinder and Kai’s big ball party. They switched everyone out of the party, almost 2,000 people switched out with their robot clones to fool Alpha Steele and get him, which was pretty good. Another reason “Wires And Nerve Volume 2” by Marissa Meyer scores a 5.5 is because the art work in this book is very well detailed and gives off a real feeling of this being an actual world. The big reason though this book doesn’t score higher is because the story is kind of a wash out season of Star Trek mixed in with wolves and a friendly T-800 from the movie Terminator. Additionally, I have a lot of questions about the characters, like how did Iko not go blade runner or go the path of Skynet from the Terminator? The reason this question came to mind is because Liam is always a jerk to her, he is always reminding her that she isn’t human and that she is replaceable like any other tech item. Furthermore if you want a better book to read I suggest “Ready Player One” by Ernest Cline because it has a way better story and has the added bonus of 90s pop culture woven into the story. But overall “Wires And Nerve Volume 2” by Marissa Meyer deserves an honest score of 5.5 out of 10.</p>
